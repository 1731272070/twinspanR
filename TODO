TODO list

Needs to fix:

- rewrite the "modified TWINSPAN" cycle in twinspan function - simplify it

Long term goals:
- add plotting function to draw hierarchical trees (based on the binary codes returned by TWINSPAN and modified TWINSPAN) - but it's not that easy, could be put for later development
- summary (or other) function could list indicator species for each split (it means to find these species in *.TWI output and format them for output)
