# twinspanR

###Author: David Zeleny

This package implements the TWINSPAN classification method (Hill 1979) and it's modified version (Rolecek et al. 2009) into R. Along to being a simple wrapper around twinspan.exe file compiled by Petr Smilauer (and based on original FORTRAN code written by Mark O. Hill), it contains also Ellenberg's dataset of Danube meadow vegetation (used as example in first TWINSPAN publication by Hill 1979).
